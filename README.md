# 🟦🟥🟨 Geometric Shape Recognition Project

This project allows you to **recognize hand-drawn geometric shapes** (such as circles, triangles, squares, etc.) using several machine learning models: **SVM**, **KNN**, and **Random Forest**. A simple web interface is provided via **Flask** for uploading images and displaying predictions.

## 🔧 Features

* 📁 Load images from the `data/train` folder
* ⚙️ Preprocessing with OpenCV (resizing, grayscale conversion, normalization)
* 🧠 Train multiple ML models (SVM, KNN, RF)
* 💾 Save trained models using joblib
* 🌐 Web interface built with Flask for predicting the shape from an image
* 📊 Display a classification report and confusion matrix
* 📈 Visualize model performance
